## Then vs Now
Taking inspiration from corsair landing page and tutorial made by Traversy Media, I learned how to make a split screen slider,
and it seemed to be a very interesting way to implement a Then vs Now page; so I made a Vitange watch vs New watch page

- Move the mouse on the screen, and the sider will with x-axis
